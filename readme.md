Important LTM Translator method changes to restore compatibility with Laravel 5.4 API. These
changes affect the order of arguments to the LTM Translator implementation. If you were using
these methods based on previous LTM implementation then you will need to make changes in your
code:

From `transChoice($id, $number, array $parameters = array(), $domain = 'messages', $locale =
null, $useDB = null)` to `transChoice($id, $number, array $parameters = array(), $locale = null,
$domain = 'messages', $useDB = null)`

From `trans($id, array $parameters = array(), $domain = 'messages', $locale = null, $useDB =
null)` to `trans($id, array $parameters = array(), $locale = null, $domain = 'messages', $useDB
= null)`

From `get($key, array $replace = array(), $locale = null, $useDB = null)` to `get($key, array
$replace = array(), $locale = null, $fallback = true, $useDB = null)`

### Version 2.4.0 released

Laravel 5.4 compatible release. No API changes only internal implementation changes.

### Version 2.3.3 released

Laravel 5.3 compatible release. For upgrade instructions see
[Upgrading 2.0, 2.1 to 2.3](../../wiki/Upgrade-2.0-to-2.3)

Now using Laravel 5 authorization API to handle all LTM related authorizations.

Find Translations now update source references for translation keys and add new keys with
cleanup of dynamic keys. Need to publish and run migrations for this update
[Installation: Publishing And Running Migrations]

Now you can view source file and line number references for translations. See
[Web Interface: Source References]

**If you are upgrading from version 2.0.x of LTM** you need to:

1. Remove the dependency to `UserPrivilegeMapper` from your application:
   [Removing dependency on UserPrivilegeMapper from service providers array] and
   [Removing dependency on UserPrivilegeMapper from facade alias array]
2. Define the abilities used by LTM: [Setting up user authorization]

### Per Locale User Access Control

Implementation changed from the last release since using a closure in config file is not
supported by the framework. Now using abilities to do the same. See
[Enabling per locale user access control]

By default this option is turned off and any user who does not have `ltm-admin-translations`
ability can modify any locale. With `user_locales_enabled` option enabled you can control which
locales a user is allowed to modify. Default for all users is all locales, unless you
specifically change that through the web UI, see [User Admin] or by populating the
`ltm_user_locales` table appropriately.
